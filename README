Genes is a HTML5 clone of a originally french game named "Evo"

This project is entirely based on node.js

IMPORTANT: At first, please run install.sh to install some node.js modules.

After this, you will be able to launch the game server with :

$ cd server
$ node server.js

To connect on the game server with your browser, just go to:

http://localhost:8088

DEVELOPER NOTES

server directory contains all server relative source files (which will be used by node.js)
client directory contains all client relative source files (which will be sent to the web client)
common directory contains all common source files (used both by server and client)
